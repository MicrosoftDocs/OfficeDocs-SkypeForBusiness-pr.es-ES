# <a name="facilitate-user-adoption-of-your-new-online-phone-system"></a>Facilitar la adopción por el usuario de su nuevo sistema telefónico en línea

Un teléfono puede ser el salvavidas de un usuario. Cambiar de un sistema telefónico tradicional a un sistema telefónico en línea representa un cambio significativo en la forma de trabajar de los usuarios y puede afectar negativamente a la productividad. Tomar tiempo para informar, guiar y apoyar a los usuarios a través de este cambio puede ayudar a garantizar una experiencia de usuario positiva y maximizar el retorno de la inversión.

Este artículo contiene plantillas de correo electrónico personalizables para ayudar a informar a los usuarios sobre su nuevo sistema telefónico. Personalice y envíe los correos electrónicos adecuados para alinearse con su implementación de voz específica. Hemos usado corchetes para indicar secciones para facilitar la personalización, pero le recomendamos que agregue mensajería específica de la organización para que el anuncio sea más relevante para los usuarios. Si es aplicable para la implementación, reemplace todas las referencias a "Teams" por "Skype Empresarial".

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT about your office desk phone
```

Cuerpo del correo electrónico:

```
Instant messaging and online meetings have become a common way to communicate
with others, but your phone can still be a lifeline to getting your job done.
From building rapport when you can't be there in person to maintaining momentum
on a project, sometimes it's easier to just pick up the phone and talk to
someone. At the same time, we understand that many of you work remotely, have
flexible work schedules or travel frequently and can't be tethered to your
desk or phone all day.

To better adapt to how you work, we want to ensure you have flexibility in how
you communicate including being able to make and receive phone calls from
anywhere, at any time. We're excited to announce that you'll soon be able
to use Microsoft Teams as your phone. This upgrade will provide
instant messaging, online meetings and phone calling all in one application,
simplifying the way you work.

Using Teams as your phone offers...

-   Flexibility - Make and receive calls anywhere, any time, across
    devices

-   Adaptability - Easily move between your headset and a variety of
    devices, including mobile

-   Capability - Transfer calls to an internal contact, external number or
    even your voicemail

-   Productivity - Call your contacts with one click, alleviating the need
    to remember phone numbers

When will phone calling be available?

We understand this is a big shift in the way you make calls today and want to
ensure you have everything you need to get started. Phone capabilities will be
enabled on <INSERT DATE>, but you can start preparing today.

    taking advantage of Teams IM and meetings capabilities, get
    started today by visiting https://aka.ms/F63e30.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: Your new phone system is live
```

Cuerpo del correo electrónico:

```
Welcome to your new phone system. Your Microsoft Teams application
has been enabled with phone calling capabilities. You should now see a dial pad
tab on your client, enabling you to make outgoing calls and listen to
your voicemail. When a call comes in, you'll receive an alert, just like you
would for an instant message. Just select the alert to answer the call – it's
that easy!

CALL TO ACTION

*  Plug in your headset, go to the Calls tab, and either
   call a contact or use the dial pad to make a call. 

*  Start a chat, and escalate it to a call.

With the launch of phone calling capabilities in Teams, we'll be
recycling your old phone, allowing for more real estate on your desk.
