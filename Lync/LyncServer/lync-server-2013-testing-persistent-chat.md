## Description

The **Test-CsPersistentChatMessage** cmdlet verifies that a pair of test users can exchange messages using the Persistent Chat service. To do this, the cmdlet logs the two users on to Lync Server 2013, connects the users to a persistent Chat room, exchanges a pair of messages, then exits the chat room and logs off the two users. Note that calls to this cmdlet will fail if you have not created any chat rooms or if the two test user accounts are not assigned a Persistent Chat policy that gives them access to the Persistent Chat service.

## Running the test

The commands shown in the following example test the ability of a pair of users (litwareinc\\pilar and litwareinc\\kenmyer) to log on to Lync Server 2013 and then exchange messages using the Persistent Chat service. To do this, the first command in the example uses the **Get-Credential** cmdlet to create a Windows PowerShell command-line interface credential object that contains the name and password of the user Pilar Ackerman. (Because the logon name, litwareinc\\pilar, was included as a parameter, the Windows PowerShell Credential Request dialog box only requires the administrator to enter the password for the Pilar Ackerman account.) The resulting credentials object is then stored in a variable named $cred1. The second command does the same thing, this time returning a credential object for the Ken Myer account.

With the credential objects in hand, the third command determines whether these two users can log on to Lync Server 2013 and exchange messages using Persistent Chat. To perform this task, the **Test-CsPersistentChatMessage** cmdlet is called using the following parameters: TargetFqdn (the FQDN of the Registrar pool); SenderSipAddress (the SIP address for the first test user); SenderCredential (the Windows PowerShell object that contains the credentials for this same user); ReceiverSipAddress (the SIP address for the other test user); and ReceiverCredential (the Windows PowerShell object that contains the credentials for the other test user).

    $cred1 = Get-Credential "litwareinc\pilar"
    $cred2 = Get-Credential "litwareinc\kenmyer"
    
    Test-CsPersistentChatMessage -TargetFqdn atl-persistentchat-001.litwareinc.com -SenderSipAddress "sip:pilar@litwareinc.com" -SenderCredential $cred1 -ReceiverSipAddress "sip:kenmyer@litwareinc.com" -ReceiverCredential $cred2

## Determining success or failure

If the specified user has a valid location policy, then you'll receive output similar to this, with the Result property marked as **Success**:

Target Fqdn : atl-cs-001.litwareinc.com

Result : Success

Latency : 00:00:00

Error Message :

Diagnosis :

If the specified users can't exchange messages using the Persistent Chat service, the Result will be shown as **Failure**, and additional information will be recorded in the Error and Diagnosis properties:

WARNING: Failed to read Registrar port number for the given fully qualified

domain name (FQDN). Using default Registrar port number. Exception:

System.InvalidOperationException: No matching cluster found in topology.

## Reasons why the test might have failed

Here are some common reasons why **Test-CsPersistentChatMessage** might fail:

  - An incorrect parameter value was supplied. The required test accounts may not exist or have been correctly created.

  - There may have been a network issue causing an unexpected delay which timed out the test.
