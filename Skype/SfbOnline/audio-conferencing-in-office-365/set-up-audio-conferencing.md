# <a name="set-up-audio-conferencing-for-skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams"></a>Configurar conferencias de Audio de Skype para la empresa y Teams de Microsoft

En algunas ocasiones, en su organización se necesitará un teléfono para llamar a una reunión. Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams include the audio conferencing feature for just this situation! People can call in to Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams meetings using a phone, instead of using the Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams app on a mobile device or PC. 
  
You only need to set up Audio Conferencing for people who plan to schedule or lead meetings. Meeting attendees who dial in don't need any licenses assigned to them or other setup.
  
For frequently asked questions about Audio Conferencing, see [Audio Conferencing common questions](audio-conferencing-common-questions.md).
  
## <a name="step-1-find-out-if-audio-conferencing-is-available-in-your-countryregion"></a>Step 1: Find out if Audio Conferencing is available in your country/region
<a name="__top"> </a>


Go to [Country and region availability for Audio Conferencing and Calling Plans](../country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans/country-and-region-availability-for-audio-conferencing-and-calling-plans.md) and select your country or region to get availability information about Audio Conferencing, as well as information about Phone System, Calling Plans, toll and toll-free numbers, and Communications Credits. 
 
## <a name="step-2-get-and-assign-licenses"></a>Step 2: Get and assign licenses
 
1. For Audio Conferencing, you need a license for each user who will set up dial-in meetings. To learn which licenses you need to buy for Audio Conferencing and how much they will cost, see [Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams add-on licensing](../skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md).
        
2. After you buy the Audio Conferencing licenses, you will ned to assign them to those people in your organization who are going to schedule or lead meetings. See [Assign or remove licenses for Office 365 for business](https://support.office.com/article/997596b5-4173-4627-b915-36abac6786dc) you purchased to the people in your organization who are going to schedule or lead meetings.
    
3. We also recommend that you assign Communications Credits licenses (they don’t cost anything) to the same people you assigned licenses to in the previous step. To learn how to set up Communications Credits, see [Set up Communications Credits for your organization](../skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/set-up-communications-credits-for-your-organization.md).
    
> [!NOTE]
> You can also set up pay-per-minute Audio Conferencing. Go [here](../skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/audio-conferencing-pay-per-minute.md) to find out more about how to use them.

## <a name="step-3-get-service-numbers-for-your-conferencing-bridges"></a>Step 3: Get service numbers for your conferencing bridges
<a name="__top"> </a>

For Audio Conferencing, you can’t use phone numbers for users; you will need to get service numbers. You can get either toll or toll-free service numbers for your conferencing bridges. There are three ways to get toll and toll-free service numbers: 
  
- **Use the Skype for Business admin center.** For some countries/regions, you can get service numbers for your conferencing bridges using the Skype for Business admin center, see [Getting service phone numbers](../what-is-phone-system-in-office-365/getting-service-phone-numbers.md).
    
- **Port your existing service numbers.** To port or transfer existing numbers from your current service provider or phone carrier to Office 365. You can see [Transfer phone numbers to Office 365](../what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/transfer-phone-numbers-to-office-365.md) or [Manage phone numbers for your organization](../what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization.md) for more information to help you do this.  
  
- **Use a request form for new numbers.** Sometimes (depending on your country/region) you won't be able to get your new service numbers using the Skype for Business admin center, or you will need specific phone numbers or area codes. En ese caso, tendrá que descargar un formulario y enviárnoslo. See [Manage phone numbers for your organization](../what-are-calling-plans-in-office-365/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization/manage-phone-numbers-for-your-organization.md) for more information. 
    
## <a name="step-4-assign-a-service-number-to-the-conferencing-bridge"></a>Step 4: Assign a service number to the conferencing bridge
<a name="__top"> </a>

Once you get your toll and/or toll-free phone numbers for your conferencing bridge, you need to assign the numbers so they can be used on meeting invites.  

To assign a new phone number to your audio conferencing bridge, go to the **Office 365 admin center** > **Admin centers** > **Skype for Business** > **Voice** > **Phone numbers**, select the phone number, and click **Assign**.

For more details, see [Assign a new phone number to your audio conferencing bridge](../audio-conferencing-in-office-365/change-the-phone-numbers-on-your-audio-conferencing-bridge.md).

## <a name="step-5-set-the-default-and-alternate-languages-for-a-conferencing-bridge"></a>Step 5: Set the default and alternate languages for a conferencing bridge
<a name="__top"> </a>

Next, you want to [Set auto attendant languages for Audio Conferencing](../audio-conferencing-in-office-365/set-auto-attendant-languages-for-audio-conferencing.md) that the conferencing auto attendant uses to greet a caller when they dial in to a phone number for Audio Conferencing. 

Go to the **Office 365 admin center** > **Admin centers** > **Skype for Business** > **Audio conferencing** > **Microsoft bridge settings**,  select the conferencing bridge phone number, and then click **Set languages**.

## <a name="step-6-set-your-conferencing-bridge-settings"></a>Step 6: Set your conferencing bridge settings
<a name="__top"> </a>
    
After setting up your conferencing bridge, verify that the default settings such as entry/exit notifications and PIN length are the ones you want to use; if they're not, you can change them. 

You can go to the **Office 365 admin center** > **Admin centers** > **Skype for Business** > **Audio conferencing** > **Microsoft bridge settings**. This will open the **Microsoft bridge settings** page. For more details, see [Change the settings for an Audio Conferencing bridge](../audio-conferencing-in-office-365/change-the-settings-for-an-audio-conferencing-bridge.md).

## <a name="step-7-assign-the-audio-conferencing-provider-and-dial-in-phone-numbers"></a>Step 7: Assign the audio conferencing provider and dial-in phone numbers

Now you need to make sure that Microsoft is assigned as the provider, and set the toll and toll-free numbers for them at the same time.

Assign Microsoft as the provider to people in your organization who lead or schedule meetings, by going to **Office 365 admin center** > **Skype for Business** > **Audio conferencing** > **Users**, and then select the user from the list and click **Edit**. If you need more details, see [Assign Microsoft as the audio conferencing provider](../audio-conferencing-in-office-365/assign-microsoft-as-the-audio-conferencing-provider.md).

When you are setting the provider, you can also set the toll and toll-free numbers that will be added to meeting invites for that user. Simply select the phone numbers from the drop-down lists. For more details, see [Set the phone numbers included on invites](../audio-conferencing-in-office-365/set-the-phone-numbers-included-on-invites.md). 


## <a name="step-8-set-up-meeting-invitations-optional"></a>Step 8: Set up meeting invitations (optional)
<a name="__top"> </a>
 
The dial-in numbers that are set for the user will be automatically added to the meeting invitations that are sent to meeting attendees. However, you can add your own help and legal links, a text message, and small company graphic if you want. See [Customize meeting invitations](../set-up-skype-for-business-online/customize-meeting-invitations.md).
